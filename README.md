## Problem:
Starting a new 42 project can be very challenging, due to its scope. Many peers get stuck in the beginning, not knowing where to start and which concepts might be helpful to fulfill the assignment.  
Frustration might follow!

## Solution:
As an MVP for our idea, we've build an enjoyable game, to make starting a project fun.  
We broke down the core curriculums `get_next_line` into the most important programming concepts and designed small mini games to teach these concepts in an entertaining and approachable manner.

### Team values:
We are all about maximizing profit and delivering industry disrupting MVPs in a fast-paced environment.
Scalability is all we care about.
